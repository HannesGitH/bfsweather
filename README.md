## Instructions

generate code with `flutter run build_runner build` (or continuously using `watch` ) and then run or build e.g. using `flutter run`

## Annotations

- currently the app isn't localized, one would normally do that but for this mvp i felt hardcoding the strings is enough for now
- test and docstrings are missing as well (would be added if this wasnt a <1Week MVP)
