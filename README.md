# bfsweather

## Instructions

### run

- download the latest APK from the releases page

### build

- get your openweather API key and store it as `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here` in a `.env.dev` file in project root

- generate code with `flutter run build_runner build` (or continuously using `watch` )

- and then run or build e.g. using `flutter run`

## Annotations

- currently the app isn't localized, one would normally do that but for this mvp i felt hardcoding the strings is enough for now
- test and docstrings are missing as well (would be added if this wasnt a <1Week MVP)
